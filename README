These are a bunch of scripts that I wrote at some point or other.

I use about half of them on a regular basis.  The other half are stupid
things that I decided to do for no reason.  Probably none of them will
be useful to anyone but me.  Be warned that many of these reveal my poor
programming skills at the time that they were written.

These constitute all of my programming output except for my homework
assignments, work with actual projects, Project Euler solutions (don't
want to give those away :) ), and my TI-89 programs (too much work).  If
you have a TI-89, you should bug me to upload those, because some of
them are really cool.

The MIT Lisense seemed to be the best fit for this, so it is all
released under that.  See the LISENSE file.
